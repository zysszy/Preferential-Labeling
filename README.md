## Experimental Results under Different Settings

### Similar to Figure 4:

Error rate versus the number of random labelings
during inference. We compare the embedding strategies for
training, and all variants use the labeling with the maximum
predicted probability for inference. 

### Similar to Figure 5:

Error rate versus the number of random labelings
during both training and inference.
